# Payload investigation

This is based on the blank Payload template. We are using this as a means of testing Payload functionality and if it will be a good candidate for our migration away from Storyblok.

## Development

1. `pnpm install && pnpm dev` to install dependencies and start the dev server
2. open `http://localhost:3000` to open the app in your browser

That's it! Changes made in `./src` will be reflected in your app. Follow the on-screen instructions to login and create your first admin user. Then check out [Production](#production) once you're ready to build and serve your app, and [Deployment](#deployment) when you're ready to go live.
